# Vehicles

Documentation of the vehicles files. It is possible to create, add and then load your own custom vehicles.

## Categories

The Categories (paths like `vehicles/engine/engine_a.json`) are considered best practice.
## Example File:
*Original file located at: 
``data/vehicles/engine/engine_a.json``*
```json
{
    "file_type": "vehicle/vehicle",
    "type": "VEHICLE_TYPE_ENGINE_A",
    "category": {
